A. The sizeof operator returns a value of type size_t, and size_t is unsigned, so the result maxbytes-sizeof(val) will be unsigned as well. Since all unsigned integers are considered to be non-negative, the conditional test will always succeed.

B. 
void copy_int(int val, void *buf, int maxbytes)
{
	if (maxbytes >= sizeof(val))
	   memcpy(buf, (void *) $val, sizeof(val));
}
